\begin{abstract}
This work introduces VTC VEGA CONTINUUM as a new conceptual framework within the Resonance Data and QIRC paradigm. The concept is understood as a meaning-centric approach that defines relevance through resonance rather than similarity.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
VTC VEGA CONTINUUM addresses a central gap in current AI research: the inability to model meaning as a dynamic, time-dependent state. This concept is embedded in the Vega Continuum.

\section{Definition of VTC VEGA CONTINUUM}
VTC VEGA CONTINUUM is a conceptual framework that models meaning not as a static point, but as a resonant state with temporal coherence.

\section{What This Is}
VTC VEGA CONTINUUM is a theoretical framework for structuring meaning in artificial systems. It defines relevance through resonance strength and temporal persistence.

\section{What This Is NOT}
VTC VEGA CONTINUUM is NOT: an algorithm, an implementation, a database, a product, a patent claim for new physics or quantum hardware.

\section{Relationship to Resonance Data and QIRC}
VTC VEGA CONTINUUM extends the foundations of Resonance Data and Quantum-Inspired Resonance Computing (QIRC) by formalizing specific aspects of meaning representation.

\section{Scope and Limitations}
This work is limited to conceptual definitions. No implementation details, algorithms, or operational architectures are disclosed.

\section{Conclusion}
VTC VEGA CONTINUUM contributes to foundational research in meaning-centric AI systems. It establishes prior art without operational disclosure.
